                                    <p> Fin-tech is booming right now and the challenge to bring banking into the modern age is facing major banks around the world. In order to help meet this challenge Citi presented Intern team in 5 Critical Mass offices around the world with a design challenge for a mobile first banking product.But with the small team of three people and only three weeks it seemed as though our main challenge would be finding the right part of the problem to solve. </p>
                                    <h2>Insight</h2>
                                    <p> To begin to tackle this challenge we conducted desk research and then created an interview script based around the jobs to be done methodologies. Using this script we conducted face to face interviews with 12 people between the ages 18-35 to better understand their banking journey and the problems they experience.And we discovered that they are dissatisfied with there banks. They have new needs and frustrations that their traditional banking experience are not addressing. But like most people they couldn't be bothered to switch bank. So they answered these new frustrations by switching some of there banking activity to new players. They use Revolute for travel, Monzo for everyday life, Paypal for online spending, Splitwise for tracking spending across their flat. They mix and match these services too try and meet their needs.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p> But its an imperfect system. They have security concerns with these start up banks, worrying if there money is safe and if they can get to it when they need it. On top of this coordinating between these apps is complicated and its hard to keep track of where all of their money really is. And to top it all off these apps are still buggy, experiencing service drop outs or systems they aren’t ready for more unique situations. </p>
                                    <p> With these insights we gathered together and ran a design studio to ideate on how we might tackle the myriad of problems facing people. To focus the session we asked those joining to consider: </p>

                                    <p> With these goals in mind we began I began wireframing the app and screen flow while our team visual designer created the branding and style for the app and our strategist created a marketing plan. </p>
                                    <p> The goal for the visual design was to remove the serious face of the bank and instead give the app more of a friendly appeal. The citi bank colour where refreshed with our target market in mind, bringing in a lighter more energetic feel. The typeface was set in all lower case to give the app a feel of friendliness and relaxed conversation. <br><br>The app name was also created: Sembl. This was distilled from the word assemble as we wanted to have a name that presented the group/sharing nature of the app. But we also chose to show this as a brand powered by Citi and thus associated with the stability and safety attached to traditional banking.<br><br>We joined our two efforts into a high fidelity prototype built in Axure. </p>

                                    <p> After submitting our pitch my team where selected to pitch to the client executive team directly in New York alongside another Critical Mass team from Calgary. We received some excellent feedback from them, particularly around the insights we had collected and how we had executed our design based on them. </p>
